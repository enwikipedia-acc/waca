            <p>After much experimentation, someone finally managed to kill ACC. So, the tool is currently offline while our resident developers pound their skulls against the furniture.</p> 
            <p>Apparently, this is supposed to fix it.</p>
            <p>Once the nature of the problem is known, we will insert it here: <b>{$dontUseDbReason}</b></p>
            <p>Once the identity of the culprit(s) is known, trout should be applied here: <b>{$dontUseDbCulprit}</b></p>
            <p>Although the tool is dead and the Bot is sleeping, email still works fine. So, we expect a swarm of irate potential editors to bury us in requests shortly. Please keep an eye on the mailing list. Remember to 'cc' or 'bcc' accounts-enwiki-l@lists.wikimedia.org when you reply to let others know you have replied.</p>
