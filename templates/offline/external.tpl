        <p>
            We’re very sorry, but the account creation request tool is currently offline while critical maintenance
            is performed. We will restore normal operations as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, you can still request an account by emailing
            <a href="mailto:accounts-enwiki-l@lists.wikimedia.org">accounts-enwiki-l@lists.wikimedia.org</a>,
            with the username that you would like. We’ll take care of your request as soon as possible.
