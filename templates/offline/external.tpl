		<h2>Our apologies!</h2>
		<p>We’re very sorry, but the account creation request tool is currently offline while critical maintenance is performed. We will restore normal operations as soon as possible.</p>
		<p>However, you can still request an account by emailing <a href="mailto:accounts-enwiki-l@lists.wikimedia.org">accounts-enwiki-l@lists.wikimedia.org</a>, with the username that you would like. We’ll take care of your request as soon as possible.</p>
		<p>Thanks for your interest in joining Wikipedia.</p>
