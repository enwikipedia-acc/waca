-- This patch script exists as a placeholder for a PHP-based migration maintenance job.
-- If you are a database build job, this job should succeed without issues
-- If you have an existing database, please use the PHP script instead, running this script will throw an error
-- If you are neither of the above, please figure out what to do yourself.
